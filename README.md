## New in v1.5.0

- DedupeStream class to read large, deduplicated objects using a stream

## Help and Support

Please contact me or file an issue here if you encounter any problems with the library or have suggestions! 

## Installing with NuGet

Due to some unforseen issues with NuGet, you may need to download and add sqlite3.dll to your project manually.  Set it to copy to output always.

## Under the Hood

The Watson Dedupe library will take an incoming byte array (which you give an object key name) and utilize a sliding window performing MD5 calculations over the data in the window to identify breakpoints in the data (this is called 'chunking').  Each chunk of data is assigned a chunk key (based on the SHA256 of the data).  MD5 is used for breakpoint identification for speed, and SHA256 is used for key assignment to practically eliminate the likelihood of hash collisions.  Tables in a Sqlite database are maintained to indicate which object keys map to which chunk keys and their ordering/position.  Chunks are stored in a directory you specify.  On retrieval, the object key data is retrieved from the index, the appropriate chunk keys are retrieved, and the object is reconstructed.  As long as the chunk data is consistent across analyzed data sets, identical chunk keys will be created, meaning duplicate data chunks are only stored once.  Further, each chunk key has a separate associated reference count to ensure that chunks are not garbage collected when a referencing object is deleted should another object also hold that reference.
 
## Test App 

Refer to the Test project which will help you exercise DedupeLibrary.  A test GUI app also exists (see https://github.com/jchristn/WatsonDedupeUI).

For an example of how to use WatsonDedupe using your own database, refer to the ```TestExternal``` project along with the sample implementation of the ```WatsonDedupe.Database.DbProvider``` class found in ```Database.cs```.

## CLI

Refer to the CLI project which provide a binary that can be used to interact with an index for object storage, retrieval, removal, and statistics.  

## Library Example

The library requires that you implement three functions within your app for managing chunk data, specifically, writing, reading, and deleting.  This was done to provide you with flexibility on where you store chunk data and how you manage it.  

The example below shows how to use WatsonDedupe with a managed internal Sqlite database.
 
```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using WatsonDedupe;

namespace WatsonDedupeSampleApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static DedupeLibrary Dedupe;
        static List<Chunk> Chunks;
        static string Key = "kjv";
        static List<string> Keys;
        static byte[] Data;

        static bool DebugDedupe = false;
        static bool DebugSql = false;
        static int NumObjects;
        static int NumChunks;
        static long LogicalBytes;
        static long PhysicalBytes;
        static decimal DedupeRatioX;
        static decimal DedupeRatioPercent;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create a new index
            Dedupe = new DedupeLibrary("Test.idx", 1024, 32768, 64, 2, WriteChunk, ReadChunk, DeleteChunk, DebugDedupe, DebugSql);

            // Load an existing index
            // Dedupe = new DedupeLibrary("Test.idx", WriteChunk, ReadChunk, DeleteChunk, DebugDedupe, DebugSql);

            // Store an object in the index
            if (Dedupe.StoreObject(Key, File.ReadAllBytes("kjv.txt"), out Chunks)) Console.WriteLine("Success");

            // Retrieve an object from the index
            if (Dedupe.RetrieveObject(Key, out Data)) Console.WriteLine("Success");

            // Check if object exists in the index
            if (Dedupe.ObjectExists(Key)) Console.WriteLine("Exists");

            // List all objects
            Dedupe.ListObjects(out Keys);

            // Gather index and dedupe stats
            if (Dedupe.IndexStats(out NumObjects, out NumChunks, out LogicalBytes, out PhysicalBytes, out DedupeRatioX, out DedupeRatioPercent))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Statistics:");
                Console.WriteLine("  Number of objects : " + NumObjects);
                Console.WriteLine("  Number of chunks  : " + NumChunks);
                Console.WriteLine("  Logical bytes     : " + LogicalBytes + " bytes");
                Console.WriteLine("  Physical bytes    : " + PhysicalBytes + " bytes");
                Console.WriteLine("  Dedupe ratio      : " + DedupeRatioX + "X, " + DedupeRatioPercent + "%");
                Console.WriteLine("");
            }

            // Delete an object from the index
            if (Dedupe.DeleteObject(Key)) Console.WriteLine("Success");
        }

        // Called during store operations, consider using FileStream with FileOptions.WriteThrough to ensure crash consistency
        static bool WriteChunk(Chunk data)
        {
            File.WriteAllBytes("Chunks\\" + data.Key, data.Value);
            return true;
        }

        // Called during read operations
        static byte[] ReadChunk(string key)
        {
            return File.ReadAllBytes("Chunks\\" + key);
        }

        // Called during delete operations
        static bool DeleteChunk(string key)
        {
            File.Delete("Chunks\\" + key);
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

## CLI Example
```
// Initialize new index
> dedupe test.idx create --params=128,4096,16,2

// Store an object
> dedupe test.idx store --chunks=chunks --key=obj1 < obj1.txt

// Retrieve an object
> dedupe test.idx retrieve --chunks=chunks --key=obj1 > obj1_new.txt

// Delete an object
> dedupe test.idx delete --chunks=chunks --key=obj1

// List objects
> dedupe test.idx list

// Check object existence
> dedupe test.idx exists --key=obj1

// Gather index stats
> dedupe test.idx stats
```

## Index Settings

Four parameters are used when creating the index: minimum chunk size, maximum chunk size, shift count, and boundary check bytes.  They are defined as follows:

- Minimum chunk size: the smallest amount of data that can be considered a chunk of data
- Maximum chunk size: the largest amount of data that can be considered a chunk of data
- Shift count: the number of bytes to move the sliding window while evaluating data in the window for a chunk boundary
- Boundary check bytes: the number of bytes in the MD5 hash of the data in the sliding window that is evaluated to identify a chunk boundary

The index parameters should be set in such a way to balance performance vs the frequency with which duplicate data is identified.  With smaller values, it is more likely the library will find repeated data patterns, but processing and storage will take longer and create more chunk records and files.  With larger values, the opposite is true.

In some cases, it is assumed that duplicate data will not be found within a file and that the library should only be used to identify large chunks of redundant data across larger files (for instance, copies of files with minor changes or backup files).  In such cases, use large values for the index settings.

In other cases, where it is assumed that duplicate data will be found within a file and across files, smaller values can be used.

Recommended settings for most environments (min, max, shift, boundary):

- For small file environments, use 1024, 8192, 64, and 2
- For large file environments, use 32768, 262144, 512, and 2 

## External Databases

External databases can be used with WatsonDedupe if you implement the ```WatsonDedupe.Database.DbProvider``` class.  You are free to use whatever table and column names you wish, since your code will be responsible for issuing queries.  Tables must be created in advance as follows (Examples shown using MySQL syntax, limited constraints are shown):

```
CREATE SCHEMA `dedupe` ;

CREATE TABLE `dedupe`.`dedupeconfig` (
  `configkey` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  `configval` VARCHAR(1024) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`configkey`),
  UNIQUE INDEX `configkey_UNIQUE` (`configkey` ASC) VISIBLE);

CREATE TABLE `dedupe`.`objectmap` (
  `objectMapId` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(1024) NULL,
  `contentLength` BIGINT(12) NULL,
  `chunkKey` VARCHAR(128) NULL,
  `chunkLength` INT NULL,
  `chunkPosition` INT NULL,
  `chunkAddress` BIGINT(12) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`objectMapId`));

CREATE TABLE `dedupe`.`chunkrefcount` (
  `chunkRefcountId` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `chunkKey` VARCHAR(128) NULL,
  `chunkLength` INT NULL,
  `refCount` INT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`chunkRefcountId`));
```
